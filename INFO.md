# Terrain Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a collection of functions for performing terrain analysis in Python. The functions are organized into the following categories:
- dem-functions: functions for working with digital elevation models (DEMs)
    - slope-functions: functions for calculating slope and aspect
    - hillshade-functions: functions for calculating hillshade
    - visualization-functions: functions for visualizing DEMs
This collection will be expanded over time to include additional functions for working with DEMs and other terrain analysis tasks.

## Prerequisites
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- [VS Code Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed
- [VS Code Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) installed

## DEM Functions
This folder comes with a handy installation guide for a GDAL environment in VS Code. See [dem-functions/README.md](dem-functions/README.md) for more information.
It contains various ways of calculating slope, aspect, and hillshade. It also contains functions for visualizing DEMs.
